Project Overview: PageRank Optimization and Search Engine Simulation


This project simulates search engine optimization strategies using PageRank to analyze and improve the ranking of Yahoo's homepage within a graph-based web structure. By manipulating the sparse adjacency matrix of links between websites, various methods were implemented to study their impact on Yahoo's PageRank.


Key Features:
Initial Analysis:
Utilized the PageRank algorithm to compute the baseline ranking of Yahoo's homepage.
Visualized distribution trends and ranked nodes within the graph.
Backlinking Strategies:
Tested the impact of additional backlinks to Yahoo from related domains.
Improved Yahoo's PageRank from its initial position to a significantly higher rank.
Link Sculpting and Obfuscation:
Redirected and reduced outgoing links from related Yahoo pages to prioritize key targets.
Simulated scenarios to boost Yahoo's PageRank by adjusting link weights within the network.
Penalty Simulation:
Modeled Google's countermeasures against obfuscation and link manipulation by penalizing manipulated backlinks.
Demonstrated a drop in PageRank due to penalties, offering insights into ranking risks.
Collaborative Link Exchanges:
Explored strategies such as collaborative link exchanges with trusted domains.
Simulated linking back to collaborators to further improve Yahooâ€™s ranking, ultimately achieving a top position.
Tools and Libraries:
Scikit-Network: Implemented PageRank for ranking calculations.
SciPy and NumPy: Used for sparse matrix operations and graph representation.
Matplotlib: Visualized distribution trends and ranking impacts.
