For a sustainable and livable colony on Mars, it is essential to automate operations and
minimize human interaction with the harsh environment. Ensuring the colony's safety and
sustainability requires reliable data reporting and management systems to track vital life
support information. Promptly addressing maintenance issues is critical to maintaining the
colony’s structural integrity.


Field engineers and scientists will need continuous updates on the status of various sectors
and habitats, relying on sensor data, along with information on equipment and vehicles.
Monitoring Mars climate to identify extreme weather events that could threaten the habitats is
equally vital.


The database system will support colony operations by focusing on:


• Environmental Monitoring
Mars presents a harsh environment with extreme temperatures, dust storms, and radiation. The
database will collect data from environmental sensors placed around the colony to track dust
levels, wind speed, temperature, radiation, and other environmental factors. This data will help
identify conditions that could impact the colony’s health and safety.


• Habitat Maintenance
Maintaining the habitats and life support systems in optimal condition is vital for the colony's
survival. The database will store sensor data on habitat conditions, including structural,
radiation levels, and internal pressure. This information will allow for early detection of issues
and enable timely maintenance, inspections, repairs, or replacements, ensuring a safe living
environment for the colonists.


• Resource Management
The database will track essential resources like oxygen, water, and food, ensuring accurate
monitoring of their availability and consumption. Real-time updates on resource levels and
usage rates will help with eﬃcient management and prevent shortages, which are crucial for
the colony’s sustainability.


• Transportation Management
Eﬃcient transportation between the colony’s sectors is critical for logistics and safety,
particularly for outdoor research and exploration. The database will manage information about
transportation vehicles, including their operational status, battery levels, and assigned tasks.
By tracking each vehicle’s location (i.e., which habitat it is stationed at) and condition, the
system will optimize energy consumption, ensure safety, and streamline transportation logistics
across the colony.
